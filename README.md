It's rather difficult sometimes to choose a career and to speak about the future profession. I'd say it's because a lot may change in our life in a moment. There are lucky people who chose their profession in childhood and since that time have been doing everything possible to acquire proficiency. But they are few.

If we are not indifferent to our future, while thinking about the future 
career we are to pay attention to a number of important things. We should determine our abilities and inclinations. Then we should analyse job prospects. We must know whether the profession we have chosen will guarantee good living conditions and give promotion. 
We must be sure we'll avoid unemployment or at least will be able to apply our knowledge and
skills in other fields of human activity. In short, we are to decide what we are going to do in ou
r life and-feel satisfied, but not bored or disappointed.
